# PasteEquation v3.2.0 - Crash-Proof Paste Release

## 🚀 Major Improvements

### Crash-Proof Paste System
- **No more Word crashes** when pasting large ChatGPT responses with many equations
- **Pre-chunking** for extremely large content (>50k characters) prevents memory overload
- **Enhanced adaptive throttling** based on existing equations, incoming equations, and content length
- **Robust error handling** with automatic recovery and clipboard preservation

### Smart Content Processing
- **Intelligent chunking** that preserves sentence boundaries for better readability
- **Progressive throttling** - more conservative approach for heavily loaded documents
- **Memory management** with automatic cleanup for very large paste operations
- **Debug logging** for troubleshooting (visible in DebugView)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Adaptive Throttling Strategy
The system now analyzes three factors to determine optimal paste speed:
- **Existing equations** in the document
- **Incoming equations** from clipboard
- **Total content length** being pasted

### Throttling Levels
- **Heavy load**: 2 items per chunk, 600ms delays (>200 existing equations OR >30 incoming OR >30k chars)
- **Medium load**: 3-5 items per chunk, 250-400ms delays
- **Light load**: 10 items per chunk, 150ms delays

### Large Content Handling
- Content over 50,000 characters is automatically split into manageable chunks
- Chunks are processed sequentially with memory cleanup between chunks
- Sentence boundaries are preserved to maintain readability

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Uninstall previous version** (if installed)
2. **Download** `setup.zip` from this release
3. **Extract** all files to a folder
4. **Run** `setup.exe` as Administrator
5. **Restart** Microsoft Word

## 📊 Performance Improvements

- **Eliminates crashes** on large ChatGPT responses (tested with 100+ equations)
- **Preserves all content** - no more missing text or equations
- **Maintains speed** for normal-sized pastes
- **Reduces memory usage** during large paste operations

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed content truncation in busy documents
- Improved clipboard handling and recovery
- Enhanced error logging for troubleshooting
- Better Word application responsiveness monitoring

## 🔄 Compatibility

- **Word 2016/2019/2021/365** (Windows)
- **.NET Framework 4.7.2** or higher
- **VSTO Runtime** (automatically installed if needed)

## 🎯 Usage

1. Copy math content from ChatGPT (with LaTeX equations)
2. Place cursor in Word document
3. Press **Ctrl+V** to paste
4. Watch as equations are automatically converted and formatted

## 📝 Notes

- The system automatically detects document load and adjusts processing speed
- Debug information is available via DebugView for troubleshooting
- Very large pastes may take longer but will complete successfully
- Original functionality is preserved for normal-sized content
